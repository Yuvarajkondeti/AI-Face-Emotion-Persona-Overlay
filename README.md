AI Face Emotion & Persona Overlay is a real-time computer vision application that detects human facial emotions through a webcam and dynamically overlays a corresponding persona-based visual effect on the user’s face.
The system uses Artificial Intelligence and OpenCV to analyze facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more, and maps each detected emotion to a predefined persona (e.g., confident, calm, energetic). This creates an interactive and visually engaging AI-driven experience.
